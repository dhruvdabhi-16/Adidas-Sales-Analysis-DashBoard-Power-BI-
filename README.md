Background
The Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard was developed to provide a unified, data-driven view of Adidas’ performance across markets, products, and retailers. Using sales data from 2020–2021, the dashboard brings together key financial metrics, geographic performance, product trends, and channel effectiveness to equip business leaders with actionable insights. By centralising total sales, profit, margins, and volume into a single analytical interface, this dashboard helps decision-makers evaluate growth patterns, optimize distribution, strengthen product strategy, and improve profitability.
# Purpose and Business Impact
In a competitive retail landscape, understanding where revenue originates—and where performance lags—is critical for sustaining growth.

The dashboard was designed to:

• Quantify overall sales and profitability performance

• Reveal high-performing and low-performing geographic markets

• Identify top product categories driving revenue

• Evaluate retailer performance based on contribution and scale

• Provide pricing and margin insights to guide revenue optimisation

This project transforms raw sales data into a strategic decision-support system, empowering Adidas to enhance sales planning, inventory strategy, and market execution.

# Key Insights from the Dashboard
a. Business Performance Overview
• Total Sales: $900M

• Operating Profit: $332M

• Units Sold: 2M

• Average Price per Unit: $45

• Operating Margin: 42%

These indicators highlight a strong year of performance with healthy margins and consistent demand across markets.

b. Monthly Sales Trends
Monthly revenue analysis reveals:

• Peak Performance:

o July ($95M) and August ($92M) are the highest-performing months.

• Low Points:

o March ($57M) and February ($61M) show weaker performance.

• Seasonal Pattern:

o Sales climb steadily from April to July, dip in early Q4, then rise again in December ($86M).

This seasonality suggests opportunities for targeted promotions during low months and inventory ramp-up during peak summer months.

c. Geographic Sales Performance (State-Level)
The filled U.S. map illustrates clear variations in state-wise performance:

• Darker regions show stronger sales concentration, indicating an established Adidas presence.

• Lighter regions represent underpenetrated areas with growth potential.

Regional disparity highlights the need for localised marketing and distribution strategies.

d. Regional Sales Contribution
Total sales by region show the following contributions:

• Northeast: $270M (30%)

• South: $186M (20.7%)

• Midwest: $163M (18.13%)

• West: $145M (16.08%)

• Southeast: $136M (15.09%)

The Northeast dominates performance, whereas the Southeast and West show room for demand stimulation.

e. Product-Level Sales Insights
Top-performing categories include:

• Men’s Street Footwear – $209M

• Women’s Apparel – $179M

• Men’s Athletic Footwear – $154M

Lower-tier categories such as Women’s Athletic Footwear ($107M) and Men’s Apparel ($124M) highlight segments that may benefit from targeted promotional strategies or product innovation.

f. Retailer Performance
Retailer revenue contribution indicates:

• West Gear: $243M

• Foot Locker: $220M

• Sports Direct: $182M

These three dominate sales volume, while Kohl’s, Amazon, and Walmart contribute modestly. The distribution mix shows a balance between specialty sports retailers and mass-market channels, suggesting opportunities to strengthen partnerships with middle-performing retailers.

# Interactivity and Functionality
The dashboard includes dynamic slicers for:

• Region

• Invoice Date

These filters allow leadership to:

• Compare performance across regions

• Analyse seasonal shifts

• Focus on specific time periods for sharper business insights

# Strategic Recommendations
A. Strengthen Marketing in Underperforming States
Use targeted campaigns to uplift sales in lighter-performing regions displayed on the heatmap.

B. Optimise Inventory Around Seasonal Trends
• Increase stock availability ahead of July–August (peak)

• Offer incentives during February–March (low demand months)

C. Boost Product Mix Profitability
• Invest in innovation and campaigns for lower-performing categories such as Women's Athletic Footwear

• Upsell premium footwear lines during peak periods

D. Enhance Retailer Engagement
• Strengthen collaborations with high-performing partners (West Gear, Foot Locker)

• Accelerate growth with mid-tier retailers through co-branded promotions

E. Pricing & Margin Strategy
• Given the strong 42% margin, Adidas can experiment with small price adjustments in high-demand categories to further boost profitability.

F. Data-Driven Regional Expansion
• The Northeast's strong share suggests replicating its sales strategies (inventory, marketing, pricing) in weaker regions.

# Conclusion
The Adidas Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-rich view of sales performance across time, geography, product categories, and retailers. With $900M in total sales, strong footwear category dominance, and clear regional leaders, the insights highlight major opportunities for strategic expansion and optimisation. By leveraging peak-season trends, strengthening underperforming markets, refining the product mix, and enhancing retailer partnerships, Adidas can further elevate its market presence and profitability.
